# Your League Manager
* An app to let rec league players keep track of their stats, teams, and leagues. They can also join teams or create their own teams and leagues. 

## How It Works
* A user sign ups for Your League Manager and gains access to the whole platform
* Once logged in a user can view their teams, leagues, and stats on their profile page and also add to their own stats.
* They have two other pages that they can view - a leagues page which wil display all the leagues and the teams within that leages. This is where the user can join a team or create their own team or league.
* The other page is a stats page where the user can view team and league stats.

## Motivation
* To help rec league players and loved ones keep track of what's happening regarding rec sports in their area.
